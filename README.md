Testing in Swift
================

A sample swift application with tests. Supplementary material to my [Testing in Swift](https://realm.io/news/testing-in-swift/) talk.

**This code requires Swift 1.2 (Xcode 6.3 beta)**.

Installation
============

Clone this repository. This explicitly includes all dependencies to reduce
likelihood of misconfiguration when copying this repository.

That being said, this repository uses [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org).

There is one change to make, which is to add [your own API key for
random.org](https://api.random.org/json-rpc/1/). Click "Get a Beta Key".

Enter your beta key into `secrets.swift`.
